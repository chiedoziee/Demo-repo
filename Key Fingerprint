Using this approach from stack overflow  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2643502/git-how-to-solve-permission-denied-publickey-error-when-using-git,

```
First start by setting up your own public/private key pair set. This can use either DSA or RSA, so basically any key you setup will work. On most systems you can use ssh-keygen.

1. First you'll want to cd into your .ssh directory. Open up the terminal and run:
cd ~/.ssh && ssh-keygen

2. Next you need to copy this to your clipboard.
On OS X run: cat id_rsa.pub | pbcopy
On Linux run: cat id_rsa.pub | xclip
On Windows (via Cygwin/Git Bash) run: cat id_rsa.pub | clip
On Windows (Powershell) run: Get-Content id_rsa.pub | Set-Clipboard (Thx to @orion elenzil)

3. Add your key to your account via the website.
4. Finally setup your .gitconfig.
git config --global user.name "bob"
git config --global user.email bob@... (don't forget to restart your command line to make sure the config is reloaded)
That's it you should be good to clone and checkout.
```
